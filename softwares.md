# Open Source codes

- [Pyccel](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel)
a Domain Specific Language enriching the *Python* syntax with additional semantic for Parallel computing. It can be used to generate (parallel) low-level code (Fortran) or to accelerate a *Python* code. Parallelism is exposed in a *pythonic* way using **OpenMP**, **MPI** and **OpenAcc**, allowing the user to focus on designing efficient algorithms without dealing with technical implementation details.
- [Psydac](https://github.com/pyccel/psydac)
  a library for solving Partial Differential Equations using Splines. Parallelism is based on **MPI**. It can be used together with Pyccel, Numba or Pythran.
- [Sympde](https://github.com/pyccel/sympde)
a Symbolic Python library for Formal Variational problems and Partial Differential Equations.
- [Gelato](https://github.com/pyccel/GeLaTo)
a library for automatic computation of the GLT symbols for Splines discretizations.
