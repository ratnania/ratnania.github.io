I am an Assistant Professor in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at [UM6P](www.um6p.ma).
Before joining UM6P, I worked at Max-Planck IPP, CEA-Cadarache and INRIA.
I hold a PhD from University of Strasbourg, a Master of Science from University Pierre et Marie Curie, and an Engineering degree from ENSIMAG.
